# HelloSampler
This is a sampler plugin using JUSE framework. Users can drag audio file to load a sound and the waveform will also be shown in the main window. Users are able to adjust the attack, release, sustain, and release of the sample. 
I created this plugin by following a tutorial series made by "The Audio Programmer" YouTube channel.
I added the comment //modifiedbyzyTheHuman to every block I modified.
Enjoy.
